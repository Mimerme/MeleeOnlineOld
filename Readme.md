# Kinda Like Dolphin - The GameCube and Wii Emulator

All the cool mumbo jumbo that actually makes this program emulate Wii and GC games to near perfect percission is done by the guys at dolphin-emu.

## What this thing does
The idea is to make it a customized build of Dolphin to make connecting and configuring Melee netplay lobbies much easier and faster.

## What I kinda want it to do
   - connect directly into a netplay lobby from some online browser/client service
      -auto configure the padding
      -run the game detect possible lag and attempt to apply fixes
   - matchmaking service
      -make sure that the fps is >=60
      -run a test service to make sure the computer is capable of a constant 60 fps
      -matcmking queue and ranking system
   - auto swaps hosts to see which connection provides the most reliable ping
